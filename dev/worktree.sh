#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Creates the git worktree for a branch, or finds it when it already exists, and prints its absolute
# path. Every pull request is built on its own branch in its own worktree under .worktrees/, never on
# main (docs/adr/0004-one-worktree-per-pull-request.md).
#
# The new worktree goes under the .worktrees/ of the checkout this runs in: the main checkout, or a
# dispatch worktree that dot-agent-deck created beside it, whose agents can then reach it without leaving
# their working directory (docs/adr/0010-create-pull-request-worktrees-inside-the-dispatch-worktree.md).
# Run from inside a pull request's worktree, it uses the checkout that holds that worktree, so pull
# request worktrees are never nested in each other.
#
# It prints only a pull request's worktree, a linked worktree directly under a .worktrees/, and refuses
# anything else in the branch's way. Every command it suggests acts on one named worktree, never on the
# whole repository.
#
# Usage: dev/worktree.sh <type>/<issue>-<slug>   (or: make worktree BRANCH=<type>/<issue>-<slug>)
