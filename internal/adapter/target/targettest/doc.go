// Package targettest provides the contract test suite every target adapter
// must pass, in the style of testing/fstest, so catalogs from different EU
// providers are comparable.
//
// An adapter test calls Run with its analysis.CatalogSource and the
// Expectations it declares for itself: its display name, the EU regions its
// offerings may be in, the taxonomy categories its catalog must serve and the
// default region its estimates use. Run wraps Check, which returns every
// violation joined in one error, each naming the check it breaks (expectations,
// catalog, target, snapshot, default-region, regions, category, repeat,
// cancel), so the suite itself is tested against fakes that
// violate it on purpose. Every Expectations field is required: an empty one is
// an expectations violation, never a check that passes vacuously. An adapter's
// own error is shown through text.Quote and stays in the violation's chain.
//
// The package is imported only from tests, but is not itself a _test package:
// adapters in other packages share it.
