# Scaleway catalog snapshot: sources

`catalog.json` is a hand-compiled, dated snapshot of what Scaleway offers, in taxonomy terms. This file
records where each fact comes from, so the snapshot can be checked and refreshed.

## How it was compiled

- **Retrieved on:** 2026-11-10.
- **Compiled, then verified against the live pages.** The snapshot was first compiled from Scaleway's
  documentation source and Go SDK at the commits below, because `www.scaleway.com` then answered HTTP 403.
  On the same date every region and capability was checked against the live public pages cited below
  (issue #15), without credentials and without calling any Scaleway API. The check changed one fact:
  Serverless Functions gained the capability `ipv6`, and its section says why. It also found one
  conflict: the availability page lists Managed Database for PostgreSQL and MySQL in Milan, but the
  product's API does not declare Milan. The region stays out, as that offering's section explains.
- **Re-verified on 2026-11-11 for PRD #14 (capability granularity).** Every high-availability claim was
  checked again, and replaced by its scoped capability (`node-high-availability` or
  `zone-high-availability`) or dropped, under the target rule and the tier-variant rule (*Rules
  applied*). `www.scaleway.com` answered HTTP 403 to every fetch that day, for the documentation pages,
  their `.md` form and the product pages. The documentation source was read instead:
  `scaleway/docs-content` `main` was still at commit `e149770a6eacd436b33ef8c36ad40cdff90ebdca`, the
  commit cited below, which issue #15 found identical to the live pages. The URLs cited are the pages
  that source publishes. The availability page answered HTTP 403 to this re-verification too, at both
  <https://www.scaleway.com/en/availability/> and the address below. The reviewer of this change read
  it the same day at <https://www.scaleway.com/en/availability/> (HTTP 200, with the regions in the
  page's embedded JSON) and found that it agrees with every region the snapshot declares. It has one
  Kapsule row and no separate row for Dedicated control planes. So no declared region changed, and the
  new variant *Kubernetes Kapsule Dedicated* lists the regions its own section gives. This
  re-verification removed `ipv6` from Serverless Functions and removed Serverless SQL Database
  (*Left out on purpose*).
- **Availability page:** <https://www.scaleway.com/en/product-availability-by-region/>, where every
  offering's regions come from, subject to the API check under *Rules applied*. It has one column per
  region (Paris, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Milan). For a zonal product it gives one mark per zone, and for a
  regional product it says "Available across the region".
  The legend has three marks: "Available", "Available soon" and "Not available". The page warns that
  "upcoming availability is based on our current roadmap and is subject to change". A plain HTTP client
  gets a JavaScript challenge instead of this page, so no copy of it was saved. It was read twice through
  a web-fetch tool, and both reads gave the same marks for every row cited below. A third read the same
  day was refused with HTTP 403. A reviewer should check the cells in a browser.
- **Documentation:** each page cited below was fetched live from `https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/`, in
  the Markdown form the site publishes beside each page (`<page>.md`, linked from
  <https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/llms.txt>). The documentation is built from
  [`scaleway/docs-content`](https://github.com/scaleway/docs-content). On the retrieval date its branch
  `main` was at commit `e149770a6eacd436b33ef8c36ad40cdff90ebdca`, the commit the snapshot was first
  compiled from, so the live pages and that source agree. A file `pages/<product>/<page>.mdx` is
  published at `https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/<product>/<page>/`.
- **Changelog:** <https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/changelog/>, read through its RSS feed
  <https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/changelog/rss.xml>. The page draws its entries in the browser. The
  changelog gives the dates of launches and betas.
- **API reference and SDK, for checking regions:** the API reference pages under
  <https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/> with the OpenAPI schemas they publish, and Scaleway's
  official Go SDK, [`scaleway/scaleway-sdk-go`](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-sdk-go), at commit
  `f408edc91a855d0b585a8fd0458f7f4761c4eefe`. That commit was still the head of `main` on the retrieval
  date. Each product API declares the regions or zones it serves (`Regions()` or `Zones()` in the SDK,
  the `region` or `zone` enum in the schema). They agree with the availability page except for Managed
  Database for PostgreSQL and MySQL in Milan. That offering's section also cites Scaleway's official
  JavaScript SDK, [`scaleway/scaleway-sdk-js`](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-sdk-js), at the
  commit given there.
- **`sourceURL`** remains the documentation root, because the capabilities come from the documentation.
  The regions come from the availability page, which each offering's section cites. The pricing page was
  not read, and it does not list per-product regions or features anyway.

  as its `LICENSE.md` states at the commit above. GitHub's licence detection reports it only as "Other".
  The site's footer reads "© 2023-2026 – Scaleway".
- **Availability page and API reference** (`www.scaleway.com/en/product-availability-by-region/`,
  `www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/`): under Scaleway's copyright, with no open licence stated. The
  availability page's footer reads "© 1999-2026 - Scaleway SAS.", and the API reference reads "© 1999 -
  2026 Scaleway. All rights reserved." Only facts are taken from these pages: where each product is
  available, and which regions each API declares.
- **OpenAPI schemas** published with the API reference: they fall under the API reference's terms, so
  all rights reserved. Only facts are taken from them: the regions and zones each schema declares.
- `scaleway/scaleway-sdk-go` and `scaleway/scaleway-sdk-js` are licensed Apache-2.0, as the `LICENSE`
  file of each states at the commit cited. Only facts are taken from them: the regions and zones each
  API declares.
- **Rule for this file and `catalog.json`:** take facts only (which product exists, in which regions, with
  which feature) and brief quotations, each in quotation marks and attributed to the page it comes from.
  Paraphrase everything else. Never copy documentation or web text in bulk, and keep it out of
  `catalog.json`, which holds only names, taxonomy terms and region codes. A refresh follows the same rule.

## Rules applied

- **Regions:** an offering lists a region only when both of these hold:
  - the availability page marks the product "Available" there, either across the region or in at least
    one of its zones ("Available soon" does not count);
  - the product's API serves the region: the SDK declares it (or at least one zone in it), or the API
    reference's schema declares it. Object Storage has no API in the SDK (it is S3-compatible), so for it
    the documentation must name an S3 endpoint in the region.

  Where the two disagree, the region is left out until they agree, and the offering's section says so.
  Zones are not modelled. Regions are within the declared list below.
- **Capabilities:** only from the taxonomy vocabulary, and only when the documentation describes the
  feature as generally available. Features in public or private beta are left out and listed under
  *Left out on purpose*.
- **Target rule** (ADR 0011): an offering lists a capability only where the documentation states it
  **in full**. An offering that meets only part of a capability's definition does not list it, and
  *Left out on purpose* records the omission with its reason. A product that does not fully serve a
  taxonomy category is not in the snapshot for that category.
- **Tier-variant rule** (ADR 0011): all of an offering's capabilities hold in **one** tier. The base
  offering is the product's default tier, or where none is stated, its lowest tier: the tier that adds
  no capability. A tier that adds a capability is a variant named `<base offering> <tier>`, with its
  own section below. A tier that only lacks capabilities gets no offering. Here the base tiers are
  Standard Multi-AZ (Object Storage, its stated default), and Standalone (Managed Database) and
  Mutualized (Kubernetes Kapsule), their products' lowest tiers, since no page names a default for
  either. The variants are *Managed Database for PostgreSQL and MySQL High Availability* and
  *Kubernetes Kapsule Dedicated*. A **Needs:** line names the tier its offering is named after, or the
  base tier.
- **Tier-variant regions:** a tier variant lists only the regions where a source states that tier, or
  where the tier's general availability predates the region's opening; the product's availability row
  alone is not enough.
- **Scope:** high availability is listed at the level the documentation states in full:
  `node-high-availability` when the offering survives the loss of a node with no manual failover,
  `zone-high-availability` when it keeps serving through the loss of a whole zone. A **Scope:** line on
  the capability says which level, and why the other is not claimed. The catalog adds node level to
  every offering that lists zone level (ADR 0011).
- **Regions and capabilities** (PRD #11's rule): a capability that holds in only some of an offering's
  regions makes a separate offering in those regions. No Scaleway capability needs one today; see
  Object Storage for the Milan check.

## Declared EU regions

`fr-par` (Paris, France), `it-mil` (Milan, Italy), `nl-ams` (Amsterdam, the Netherlands), `pl-waw` (Warsaw,
Poland).

- The availability page has exactly these four regions, and labels each of them "3 AZ". SDK
  `scw/locality.go` defines the same four regions, each with three zones.
- `it-mil` is recent. The changelog entry *New region opening - MIL-1 is now available!* (2026-03-10)
  opens Milan with one zone, for "Instances, Kapsule, Block Storage, Object Storage, VPC, Databases, KMS,
  Audit Trail, and more". Serverless Containers and Container Registry arrived there on 2026-08-31. The
  entry *A full 3-AZ Region in Milan!* (2026-10-12) adds zones MIL-2 and MIL-3, naming Instances, Block
  Storage and the Object Storage Standard Multi-AZ class. Some pages still name only Paris, Amsterdam and
  Warsaw: the Instances FAQ, the Block Storage concepts page, and the introductions of the Kubernetes and
  Managed Database API references.

## Offerings

### Block Storage

Category `storage.block`. Pages: <https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/block-storage/concepts/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/block-storage/faq/>.

- `snapshots`: the concepts page describes volumes that "can be snapshotted", and the FAQ covers snapshot
  export and import.
- Regions `fr-par`, `it-mil`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw`: the availability page marks Block Storage 5k and Block
  Storage 15k available in all three zones of each of the four regions. SDK `api/block/v1` serves all
  twelve zones.

### Elastic Metal

Category `compute.vm` (dedicated servers running a general purpose operating system). Pages:
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/elastic-metal/faq/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/elastic-metal/reference-content/elastic-metal-networking/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/ipam/reference-content/ipv6/>.

- `ipv6`: the FAQ says servers are "delivered with an IPv6 address (/128) pre-configured", and flexible
  IPv6 /64 subnets can be ordered. The page *IPv6 and the Scaleway ecosystem* lists Elastic Metal among
  the products that support IPv6.
- Regions `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw`: the availability page marks the Aluminium, Beryllium, Iridium and
  Lithium ranges available in two zones each of Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw. It marks no Elastic Metal
  range available in Milan. SDK `api/baremetal/v1` serves fr-par-1, fr-par-2, nl-ams-1, nl-ams-2,
  pl-waw-2 and pl-waw-3.

### Instances

Category `compute.vm`. Pages: <https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/instances/concepts/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/instances/how-to/use-flexips/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/ipam/reference-content/ipv6/>.

- `ipv6`: flexible routed IPv6 gives each Instance a public /64 prefix (use-flexips page). The page *IPv6
  and the Scaleway ecosystem* lists Instances among the products that support IPv6.
- `snapshots`: the concepts page defines snapshots and images built from them; the Elastic Metal FAQ
  contrasts Elastic Metal with "Instances, which have the snapshot feature".
- Regions `fr-par`, `it-mil`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw`: the availability page marks the PRO2 range, among
  others, available in all three zones of Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw. It marks the BASIC3-X,
  STANDARD3-X, COMPUTE3-X and MEMORY3-X ranges available in all three Milan zones, as well as in Paris
  and Amsterdam. SDK
  `api/instance/v1` serves every Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw zone but only it-mil-1; both Milan changelog
  entries name Instances.

### Kubernetes Kapsule

Category `kubernetes.managed`. Pages: <https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/kubernetes/concepts/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/kubernetes/faq/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/kubernetes/reference-content/kubernetes-control-plane-offers/>.

The base offering is the lowest control-plane tier, **Mutualized**: a shared control plane that the
concepts page describes as "suitable for development, testing, staging environments or production
workloads with standard availability requirements". No page read names a default tier. Mutualized is
taken as the base because it is the tier that adds no capability; every Dedicated tier adds one. The
control-plane type is chosen when the cluster is created (FAQ).

- `autoscaling`: pools autoscale between a minimum and maximum node count (concepts *Autoscale*, FAQ).
  **Needs:** nothing beyond the base tier, Mutualized.
- No high availability: the Mutualized tier runs "1 resilient replica" of the API server and has no SLA
  (control-plane offers page). Its etcd keeps "3 replicas in multi-AZ", which protects the cluster's
  state, not the API server's availability. The Dedicated tiers add high availability, in the variant
  *Kubernetes Kapsule Dedicated*.
- Regions `fr-par`, `it-mil`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw`: the availability page marks Kapsule "Available across
  the region" in all four regions, and the changelog entry opening MIL-1 (2026-03-10) names Kapsule. SDK
  `api/k8s/v1` and the schema of the Kubernetes API reference
  (<https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/kubernetes/>) declare all four regions, although the API
  reference's introduction names only Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw.

### Kubernetes Kapsule Dedicated

Category `kubernetes.managed`. A variant of *Kubernetes Kapsule* (tier-variant rule): a cluster with a
Dedicated control plane, Dedicated 4, 8 or 16, which share the same availability row. Pages:
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/kubernetes/reference-content/kubernetes-control-plane-offers/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/kubernetes/concepts/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/kubernetes/reference-content/multi-az-clusters/>.

- `autoscaling`: as for the base offering; autoscaling has no tier restriction (concepts *Autoscale*).
  **Needs:** nothing beyond this variant's tier, a Dedicated control plane (autoscaling itself has no
  tier restriction).
- `node-high-availability`. **Needs:** a Dedicated control plane (Dedicated 4, 8 or 16). The
  control-plane offers page gives these tiers "2 replicas for HA" of the API server, etcd "3 replicas in
  multi-AZ", and a "99.5% uptime" SLA (the Mutualized tier: "1 resilient replica", SLA "N/A"). So the
  control plane survives the loss of a node with no manual failover. **Scope: node level only.** The
  concepts page says a regional cluster spreads control-plane replicas "across multiple zones", and is
  "only available with HA Dedicated control planes". But the Multi-AZ clusters page, *Limitations*,
  says the control plane is reached through a Load Balancer in the region's primary zone, and "If this
  zone fails globally, the control plane will be unreachable, even if the cluster spans multiple zones.
  This limitation also applies to HA Dedicated control planes." The cluster therefore does not keep
  serving through the loss of every zone, and `zone-high-availability` is not claimed (target rule).
- Regions `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` (tier-variant regions rule). The changelog entry *Dedicated
  control plane offers are now available!* (2023-09-06) announces general availability; it names no
  region and predates Warsaw and Milan. Warsaw has its own entry, *Dedicated control plane offers now
  available in Warsaw* (2023-12-15). `fr-par` and `nl-ams` are inferred from the GA date and the
  product's availability row, which marks Kapsule in both. No page read names Paris or Amsterdam for
  the Dedicated tier.
  **Milan is left out:** nothing read states Dedicated control planes in Milan, and Milan opened after
  the GA entry. The entry opening MIL-1 (2026-03-10) names "Kapsule", not the tier, and the
  availability page has one Kapsule row, with no separate row for Dedicated control planes. Add
  `it-mil` once a source states it.

### Managed Database for PostgreSQL and MySQL

Categories `database.mysql` and `database.postgresql`: one product for both engines, with the same
features. Pages: <https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/faq/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/create-a-database/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-read-replicas/>.

The base offering is the lowest node configuration, **Standalone**: the page *Create a Database
Instance* offers "High Availability", listed first, and "Standalone: creates a standalone database
provisioned on a single node". No page read names a default. Standalone is taken as the base because
it is the tier that adds no capability; High Availability adds one. The concepts page says a
standalone node can be upgraded to High Availability after creation, "but not the opposite". The High
Availability option is the variant *Managed Database for PostgreSQL and MySQL High Availability*.
Every capability below has **Needs:** nothing beyond the base tier, Standalone.

- `encryption-at-rest`: LUKS volume encryption, generally available since 2025-01-16 (changelog).
- `read-replicas`: Read Replicas for PostgreSQL and MySQL Database Instances. The page *Manage Read
  Replicas* sets no High Availability requirement, so both tiers list it.
- `snapshots`: Database snapshots of the instance's volume (concepts *Database snapshot*).
- No high availability: a Standalone instance runs on a single node.
- Regions `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw`: the availability page marks the product "Available across the
  region" in each of them. SDK `api/rdb/v1` and the schema of the Managed Database API reference
  (<https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/managed-database-postgre-mysql/>) declare these three
  regions.
- **Milan is left out until the API declares it.** The availability page also marks the product
  "Available across the region" in Milan, but nothing in its API declares `it-mil`. The API reference
  says the product "is available in the Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw regions", its OpenAPI schema has no
  `it-mil`, and SDK `api/rdb/v1` declares the same three regions. The Kubernetes API's schema, by
  contrast, does declare `it-mil`. No request was sent to the API, so this records what the API
  declares, not how it would answer a request for Milan. The other evidence, on each side:
  - For Milan: the changelog entry opening MIL-1 names "Databases" without saying which product. The
    documentation page *Audit Trail product integration*, file
    `pages/audit-trail/reference-content/resource-integration-with-adt.mdx` in `scaleway/docs-content` at
    commit `e149770a6eacd436b33ef8c36ad40cdff90ebdca` (retrieved 2026-11-10; CC BY-NC-SA 4.0), lists
    "PostgreSQL & MySQL" among the products integrated with Audit Trail, with the supported regions
    fr-par, nl-ams, pl-waw and it-mil.
  - Against Milan: Scaleway's official JavaScript SDK, file `packages_generated/rdb/src/v1/api.gen.ts`
    in `scaleway/scaleway-sdk-js` at commit `c3924dd9e33b03b634f05dec84534d7db17443b9`, the head of
    `main` on the retrieval date (retrieved 2026-11-10; Apache-2.0), declares the Managed Database API's
    regions as fr-par, nl-ams and pl-waw only.

  Add `it-mil` once the SDK or the API reference's schema declares it.

### Managed Database for PostgreSQL and MySQL High Availability

Categories `database.mysql` and `database.postgresql`. A variant of *Managed Database for PostgreSQL and
MySQL* (tier-variant rule): a Database Instance created with, or upgraded to, the High Availability node
configuration. Pages:
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/concepts/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/faq/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/create-a-database/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases-for-postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/manage-read-replicas/>.
Its `encryption-at-rest`, `read-replicas` and
`snapshots` are the base offering's, and hold on this tier too.

- `node-high-availability`. **Needs:** the High Availability option. A hot standby node, kept current
  by synchronous replication, takes over when the main node fails: "If the main node fails for any
  reason, the standby can take over requests" (concepts *High availability*). **Scope: node level
  only.** The FAQ says: "In a high-availability cluster, active and hot standby nodes are indeed
  located in the same data center but in two separate racks." The pair survives the loss of a node, not
  the loss of the data centre or zone, so `zone-high-availability` is not claimed.
- Regions `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw`: the base offering's regions, for the same reasons; no page
  limits the High Availability option to some regions.

### Object Storage

Category `storage.object`. Pages: <https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/object-storage/concepts/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/object-storage/faq/>.

The base offering is the default storage class, **Standard Multi-AZ** (S3 class `STANDARD`). The page
*Object operations* (<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/object-storage/api-cli/object-operations/>)
says: "If no class is specified via the `--storage-class <class>` option, the object is created as
Standard (Multi-AZ) by default." Standard One Zone and Glacier only lack capabilities, so they get no
offering (tier-variant rule). Every capability below has **Needs:** nothing beyond the default class,
Standard Multi-AZ.

- `encryption-at-rest`: server-side encryption with SSE-C, SSE-ONE and SSE-KMS (FAQ *How can I encrypt
  my objects?*).
- `object-versioning`: bucket versioning (concepts *Versioning*; the 2026-05-20 changelog adds full
  versioning and Object Lock support to the console).
- No high availability: see *Left out on purpose*.
- Regions `fr-par`, `it-mil`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw`: the availability page marks the Standard Multi-AZ and
  Standard One Zone classes "Available across the region" in all four regions. The concepts page lists
  an S3 endpoint in each of the four regions. Object Storage has no API in the SDK (it is S3-compatible).
- **Milan multi-AZ (PRD #11's open question), resolved: no split.** PRD #11 asked whether Scaleway
  should follow OVHcloud's rule, a separate offering where a capability holds only in some regions.
  The changelog entry *A full 3-AZ Region in Milan!* (2026-10-12) names the "Object Storage Standard
  Multi-AZ class" among the products in MIL-2 and MIL-3, and the availability page marks that class in
  all four regions. So the default class is the same in every region, and the offering needs no
  regional split. The concepts page and the quickstart still say Standard Multi-AZ "is available in the
  Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw regions"; like the Instances FAQ and the Block Storage concepts page,
  they predate the Milan entry and are stale. Since Object Storage now lists no capability that
  depends on zones, the question would only matter again if a refresh found the default class missing
  from a region, and then the region rule applies.

### Queues

Category `messaging.queue`. Pages: <https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/queues/concepts/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/queues/faq/>.

- `dead-letter-queue`: dead-letter (undelivered-message) queues with a maximum receive count, available
  since 2025-04-01 (changelog).
- Regions `fr-par`, `nl-ams`: the availability page marks Queues available in Paris and Amsterdam, and
  "Not available" in Warsaw and Milan. SDK `api/mnq/v1beta1` `SqsAPI` serves the same two regions.

### Serverless Functions

Category `serverless.function`. Pages: <https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless-functions/faq/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless-functions/reference-content/functions-autoscaling/>,
<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/ipam/reference-content/ipv6/>.

- `autoscaling`: functions scale between a minimum (down to zero) and maximum number of instances with
  demand.
- No `ipv6`: see *Left out on purpose*.
- Regions `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw`: the availability page marks Serverless Functions available in
  Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw, and "Available soon" in Milan, so `it-mil` is not listed. SDK
  `api/function/v1beta1` serves the same three regions.

## Left out on purpose

- **Instances `autoscaling`:** Autoscaling groups are in public beta. The changelog entry *Autoscaling
  Groups in Public Beta* (2026-08-25) opens them in fr-par, nl-ams and pl-waw, no later entry announces
  general availability, and the Autoscaling Groups API guide
  (<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/instances/api-cli/getting-started-autoscaling-groups/>) still
  requires "Beta access".
- **Block Storage `encryption-at-rest`:** the Key Manager encryption page
  (<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/block-storage/api-cli/encrypt-volumes-with-key-manager/>, validated
  2026-10-15) says volume encryption "is currently in Private Beta, and is only available via the Block
  Storage API".
- **Elastic Metal `snapshots`:** the FAQ says Elastic Metal servers must be backed up differently from
  Instances, which have the snapshot feature.
- **Managed Database `point-in-time-restore` and `ipv6`:** no point-in-time restore is documented (backups
  are restored as taken; snapshots and clones copy the current state), and the FAQ says IPv6 is not
  supported.
- **`ipv6` on Kubernetes Kapsule (both tiers), Object Storage and Queues:** the page *IPv6 and
  the Scaleway ecosystem* (<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/ipam/reference-content/ipv6/>) lists the
  products that support IPv6, and none of these is among them. It says that "Products other than those
  listed here do not officially support IPv6", and names Managed Databases and Kubernetes Kapsule among
  them.
- **Products not in the snapshot:** Kubernetes Kosmos (multi-cloud Kubernetes whose nodes may run
  outside Scaleway; Kapsule already serves the category); Serverless Containers and Serverless Jobs
  (containers and batch jobs, not per-invocation functions); NATS and Topics and Events (streams and
  pub/sub, not queues); Managed Database for Redis and Document Database (no matching taxonomy category);
  Serverless SQL Database (see below).
- **Serverless SQL Database, removed from the snapshot (PRD #14, target rule).** It is a
  PostgreSQL-compatible database with documented differences from standard PostgreSQL: the
  known-differences page
  (<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless-sql-databases/reference-content/known-differences/>)
  lists, because of connection pooling and scaling to zero, no temporary tables or views, no
  subscriptions, no prepared transactions, and no guarantee for `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`, advisory locks or
  session settings, and it points to Managed Database for PostgreSQL where strict compatibility is
  needed. So it does not fully serve `database.postgresql`, and a PostgreSQL workload is pointed at
  Managed Database instead. It returns once a report can say "compatible, with differences".
- **Serverless Functions `ipv6` (PRD #14, target rule).** `ipv6` means IPv6 connectivity in both
  directions (ADR 0011). The page *IPv6 and the Scaleway ecosystem*
  (<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/ipam/reference-content/ipv6/>), section *Serverless Functions and
  Containers and IPv6*, says only that "A function or container endpoint resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses (dual stack)": inbound traffic only. Nothing documents IPv6 for traffic a function sends.
- **Object Storage `node-high-availability` and `zone-high-availability` (PRD #14, target rule).** The
  FAQ (<https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/object-storage/faq/>) says Standard Multi-AZ distributes data
  "across three different Availability Zones (AZ). In the event of a complete data center failure in an
  AZ, we are still able to rebuild your data and make it accessible". Rebuilding the data and making it
  accessible again is recovery, not continuity without manual failover, so neither level is stated in
  full. Node level is not claimed either: the FAQ describes Standard One Zone's three racks as where
  data is stored, not as continuity of service.
- **Kubernetes Kapsule Dedicated `zone-high-availability`:** the control plane is reached through a Load
  Balancer in the region's primary zone and is unreachable if that zone fails, "This limitation also
  applies to HA Dedicated control planes" (Multi-AZ clusters page,
  <https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/kubernetes/reference-content/multi-az-clusters/>). See that
  offering's section.
- **Managed Database `zone-high-availability`:** the High Availability option keeps both nodes in one
  data centre (FAQ). A Read Replica can be "Multi-AZ", hosted in a different zone (page *Manage Read
  Replicas*), but promoting it is a manual, irreversible step ("It is possible to promote a Read Replica
  node to a standalone Database Instance"), so it is not failover without manual action, and neither
  tier lists zone level.
