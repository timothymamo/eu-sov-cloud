# Build an inventory from your cloud

Turn your AWS, GCP or Azure estate into an inventory file that `shift2eu assess` reads, using only
the provider's own command-line tool, read-only credentials and `jq`. You run a handful of list and
describe calls, save their output in one directory, and run one `jq` program from this repository
over it. This is an interim path: `shift2eu discover`, which will do the same from inside the tool,
does not exist yet.

## Before you start

You need:

- the provider's CLI (`aws` version 2, `gcloud`, or `az` with the `resource-graph` extension),
  signed in the way you normally sign in. Every command below uses the CLI's default credential
  chain; nothing here asks you to print, paste or store a credential;
- `jq` (the programs are tested with jq 1.8);
- `shift2eu` ([Install](install.md)), or a clone with `make build`;
- the programs from this repository, `docs/guide/inventory/aws.jq`, `gcp.jq` and `azure.jq`. A
  release archive ships them under `docs/guide/inventory/` too.

Every command on this page reads: it lists, describes, gets, searches or queries, and never creates,
updates, deletes or tags anything. Where a provider's inventory service must be switched on first
(AWS Config, the GCP Cloud Asset API), this page says so and leaves that to your cloud administrator.

## The inventory format in brief

An inventory is a JSON object with a version, the source and a list of resources.
[ADR 0006](../adr/0006-json-inventory-file-format-v1.md) records the format in full; the reader is
strict, so a misspelt key or an unknown value is an error, never ignored.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "source": "aws",
  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "shop-db",
      "rawType": "AWS::RDS::DBInstance",
      "category": "database.postgresql",
      "region": "eu-central-1",
      "capabilities": ["point-in-time-restore", "zone-high-availability"]
    },
    { "id": "shop-cdn", "rawType": "AWS::CloudFront::Distribution", "category": "unclassified" }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | yes | Always `1` |
| `source` | yes | `aws`, `gcp` or `azure` here |
| `resources[].id` | yes, unique | A short name for the resource |
| `resources[].category` | yes | A taxonomy category, below |
| `resources[].rawType` | no | The source's own type name |
| `resources[].region` | no | The source region; absent for a global resource |
| `resources[].capabilities` | no | Capabilities the resource depends on, below |

The **taxonomy categories** are the only bridge between a source and a target: `compute.vm` (a
virtual machine), `compute.baremetal` (a dedicated physical server, with no hypervisor; see
[ADR 0023](../adr/0023-separate-bare-metal-servers-from-virtual-machines-in-the-taxonomy.md)),
`kubernetes.managed`, `storage.object`, `storage.block`, `database.postgresql`, `database.mysql`,
`serverless.function` and `messaging.queue`. A resource that fits none of them is `unclassified`
and keeps its `rawType`: it then shows up in the report as a blocker on every target, instead of
disappearing from the assessment.

The **capabilities** are features a resource depends on:

| Capability | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ipv6` | Reachable over IPv6 and can reach IPv6 destinations |
| `point-in-time-restore` | Data can be restored to any moment in a retention window |
| `object-versioning` | Earlier versions of overwritten or deleted objects are kept |
| `node-high-availability` | Keeps serving through the loss of one node, without manual failover |
| `zone-high-availability` | Keeps serving through the loss of a zone; implies `node-high-availability` |
| `read-replicas` | Reads are served from replicas of a primary database |
| `autoscaling` | Capacity is added and removed with load |
| `encryption-at-rest` | Stored data is encrypted |
| `snapshots` | Point-in-time copies of a volume or machine are taken |
| `dead-letter-queue` | Messages that keep failing are set aside |

A capability changes the verdict: an offering that serves the category but lacks a capability the
resource lists is a partial fit, not a direct one, and the report names the missing capability. A
capability left out can therefore make a move look easier than it is, which is why the programs
derive them from the resources' settings rather than leaving them out.

## How the programs work

There is one program per source under `docs/guide/inventory/`: `aws.jq`, `gcp.jq` and `azure.jq`.
For each source you:

1. run the source's commands below, which write their JSON output into one directory
   (`inventories/aws/<region>/`, `inventories/gcp/` or `inventories/azure/`);
2. run the source's program once, with `jq -n`, over every file in that directory, and redirect the
   result to `inventories/<source>.inventory.json`;
3. review the inventory, and delete the collected directory.

Run the commands from the directory you want the files in, such as a clone of this repository:
`inventories/` and `*.inventory.json` are in its `.gitignore`, so neither the raw output nor an
inventory can be committed by accident.

The collected directory is the providers' raw output. The commands keep only the fields the programs
read (`--query` for `aws` and `az`, a `--format` projection and a `jq` filter for `gcloud`), so it
holds no environment variables, startup scripts, admin user names or SSH keys, and no tag or label
values beyond the few the programs read, except inside an AKS cluster's node pools, which the Azure
query keeps whole. It still holds full ARNs and resource IDs, which carry the account, project or
subscription, and can hold IP addresses, tag keys, and an AKS node pool's labels, tags (keys and
values), taints, subnet ID and node image version. Share only the reviewed inventory file, never the
directory, and delete the directory once the inventory is built (see [Privacy](#privacy)).

The loops below go on when one call fails, so read what they print on stderr. A failed call
(`AccessDenied`, `AuthorizationFailed`, `PERMISSION_DENIED`) means the setting it reads is missing
from the inventory: the resource is still listed, but without the capability that setting would have
added, which makes a move look easier than it is. Fix the permission and collect again, or add the
capability by hand.

A program recognises each input by its shape, not by its file name, so the file names below are only
a convention, and a file may hold several JSON documents one after the other (the loops below write
them that way). The program header lists the shapes it reads.

The programs classify by the tables in each source's section: a `rawType` becomes a taxonomy
category, and a setting becomes a capability. They state how a source's resources map to the
taxonomy, nothing else; which target offers what is the catalog's business, decided by `assess`.

The programs write short IDs (an instance ID, a bucket, database or queue name), never an ARN, a full
GCP resource name or an Azure resource ID, which carry the account, project or subscription. Two
resources with the same short name, such as a function and a queue both called `orders`, get their
type and region appended (`orders (AWS::SQS::Queue, eu-central-1)`) so every ID stays unique.

The commands are written for a POSIX shell (bash, zsh).

## AWS

### AWS permissions

The AWS managed policy `ReadOnlyAccess` covers every call. It also lets its holder read your data
(objects in buckets, for example), so prefer a policy, created by your administrator, that allows
only the calls this page makes:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
        "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
        "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups",
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
        "s3:GetBucketVersioning",
        "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
        "eks:ListClusters",
        "eks:DescribeCluster",
        "eks:ListNodegroups",
        "eks:DescribeNodegroup",
        "lambda:ListFunctions",
        "sqs:ListQueues",
        "sqs:GetQueueAttributes",
        "config:SelectResourceConfig"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

`ViewOnlyAccess` is narrower than `ReadOnlyAccess`: it lists and describes resources and grants no
reads of your data. It may lack some of the actions above, though, so check it against this list with
the IAM policy simulator before you rely on it. The custom policy above is the minimal option.

### Collect from AWS

Run these once per region you use, with the region in `AWS_REGION`. Each region's output goes to a
directory of its own:

```bash
export AWS_REGION=eu-central-1
out="inventories/aws/$AWS_REGION"
mkdir -p "$out"

aws ec2 describe-instances --output json --query '{Reservations: Reservations[].{Instances: Instances[].{
  InstanceId: InstanceId, InstanceType: InstanceType, State: {Name: State.Name},
  Placement: {AvailabilityZone: Placement.AvailabilityZone},
  BlockDeviceMappings: BlockDeviceMappings[].{Ebs: {VolumeId: Ebs.VolumeId}},
  NetworkInterfaces: NetworkInterfaces[].{Ipv6AddressCount: length(Ipv6Addresses || `[]`)},
  Tags: Tags[].{Key: Key}}}}' > "$out/ec2-instances.json"
aws ec2 describe-volumes --output json --query '{Volumes: Volumes[].{
  VolumeId: VolumeId, AvailabilityZone: AvailabilityZone, Encrypted: Encrypted,
  Attachments: Attachments[].{InstanceId: InstanceId, DeleteOnTermination: DeleteOnTermination}}}' \
  > "$out/ec2-volumes.json"
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --owner-ids self --output json \
  --query '{Snapshots: Snapshots[].{VolumeId: VolumeId}}' > "$out/ec2-snapshots.json"
aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --output json --query '{AutoScalingGroups: AutoScalingGroups[].{
  AutoScalingGroupName: AutoScalingGroupName, AutoScalingGroupARN: AutoScalingGroupARN,
  MinSize: MinSize, MaxSize: MaxSize, AvailabilityZones: AvailabilityZones,
  Tags: Tags[].{Key: Key}}}' > "$out/autoscaling-groups.json"

aws s3api list-buckets --output json \
  --query '{Buckets: Buckets[].{Name: Name, BucketRegion: BucketRegion}}' > "$out/s3-buckets.json"
jq -r '.Buckets[].Name' "$out/s3-buckets.json" | while read -r bucket; do
  aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket "$bucket" --output json --query '{Status: Status}' |
    jq --arg bucket "$bucket" '{Bucket: $bucket, Versioning: .}'
done > "$out/s3-versioning.json"

aws rds describe-db-instances --output json --query '{DBInstances: DBInstances[].{
  DBInstanceIdentifier: DBInstanceIdentifier, DBInstanceArn: DBInstanceArn,
  DBClusterIdentifier: DBClusterIdentifier, Engine: Engine,
  BackupRetentionPeriod: BackupRetentionPeriod, MultiAZ: MultiAZ, StorageEncrypted: StorageEncrypted,
  ReadReplicaDBInstanceIdentifiers: ReadReplicaDBInstanceIdentifiers}}' > "$out/rds-instances.json"

aws eks list-clusters --output json | jq -r '.clusters[]' | while read -r cluster; do
  aws eks describe-cluster --name "$cluster" --output json \
    --query '{cluster: {name: cluster.name, arn: cluster.arn}}'
  aws eks list-nodegroups --cluster-name "$cluster" --output json | jq -r '.nodegroups[]' |
    while read -r nodegroup; do
      aws eks describe-nodegroup --cluster-name "$cluster" --nodegroup-name "$nodegroup" \
        --output json --query '{nodegroup: {clusterName: nodegroup.clusterName,
          nodegroupArn: nodegroup.nodegroupArn, scalingConfig: nodegroup.scalingConfig,
          resources: {autoScalingGroups: nodegroup.resources.autoScalingGroups}}}'
    done
done > "$out/eks.json"

aws lambda list-functions --output json \
  --query '{Functions: Functions[].{FunctionName: FunctionName, FunctionArn: FunctionArn}}' \
  > "$out/lambda-functions.json"

aws sqs list-queues --output json | jq -r '.QueueUrls[]?' | while read -r queue; do
  aws sqs get-queue-attributes --queue-url "$queue" --output json \
    --attribute-names QueueArn RedrivePolicy SqsManagedSseEnabled KmsMasterKeyId
done > "$out/sqs-queues.json"

# Optional: everything else, from AWS Config (see "Everything else on AWS").
aws configservice select-resource-config \
  --expression "SELECT resourceId, resourceName, resourceType, awsRegion" \
  --output json > "$out/config.json"
```

Every list and describe call above, `select-resource-config` included, is paginated by AWS, and the
AWS CLI version 2 fetches every page and merges them before it applies `--query`, so each file holds
the whole region. Do not pass `--no-paginate` or `--max-items`.

S3 is global: `list-buckets` returns every bucket from any region, and the program lists each bucket
once. A bucket's region comes from the `BucketRegion` field, which recent versions of the AWS CLI
version 2 print; with an older CLI, buckets have no region.

### Build the AWS inventory

```bash
jq -n -f docs/guide/inventory/aws.jq inventories/aws/*/*.json > inventories/aws.inventory.json
```

Review `inventories/aws.inventory.json`, then delete the raw output: `rm -r inventories/aws`.

### AWS classification

The `rawType` is the resource's AWS CloudFormation type.

| `rawType` | Category | Read from |
|---|---|---|
| `AWS::EC2::Instance`, a `*.metal` or `*.metal-*` instance type (such as `m5.metal`, `c7i.metal-24xl`) | `compute.baremetal` | `ec2 describe-instances` |
| `AWS::EC2::Instance`, any other instance type | `compute.vm` | `ec2 describe-instances` |
| `AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup` | `compute.vm` | `autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups` |
| `AWS::EC2::Volume` | `storage.block` | `ec2 describe-volumes` |
| `AWS::S3::Bucket` | `storage.object` | `s3api list-buckets` |
| `AWS::RDS::DBInstance`, engine `postgres` or `aurora-postgresql` | `database.postgresql` | `rds describe-db-instances` |
| `AWS::RDS::DBInstance`, engine `mysql` or `aurora-mysql` | `database.mysql` | `rds describe-db-instances` |
| `AWS::RDS::DBInstance`, any other engine (MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server) | `unclassified` | `rds describe-db-instances` |
| `AWS::RDS::DBCluster` (Aurora) | none: its instances stand for it | `configservice select-resource-config` |
| `AWS::EKS::Cluster` | `kubernetes.managed` | `eks describe-cluster` |
| `AWS::Lambda::Function` | `serverless.function` | `lambda list-functions` |
| `AWS::SQS::Queue` | `messaging.queue` | `sqs get-queue-attributes` |
| any other type AWS Config records | `unclassified` | `configservice select-resource-config` |

Left out:

- instances that are terminated or shutting down, and instances an Auto Scaling group launched (tag
  `aws:autoscaling:groupName`): the group stands for them. Their volumes that are deleted with them
  (`DeleteOnTermination`), such as their root volumes, go with them;
- the nodes of an EKS cluster, which the cluster stands for: the Auto Scaling group of a managed node
  group (`describe-nodegroup` names it), instances and Auto Scaling groups tagged `eks:cluster-name`
  or `kubernetes.io/cluster/<name>`, and a node's volumes that are deleted with it
  (`DeleteOnTermination`). A volume that outlives its node, such as a persistent volume, stays;
- an Aurora cluster (`AWS::RDS::DBCluster`, which AWS Config lists): Aurora is assessed per instance,
  and each instance of the cluster is a `database.postgresql` or `database.mysql` resource. Its
  capabilities come from the instance's settings, and Aurora keeps replicas and zone redundancy at the
  cluster level, as more instances in other zones, which the instance does not report: add
  `read-replicas` or `zone-high-availability` by hand when the cluster has them.

An Auto Scaling group is always `compute.vm`: the guide does not read its launch template, so a
group of `*.metal` instances is classified as a group of virtual machines. Change its category to
`compute.baremetal` by hand if it runs bare-metal instances.

An EKS cluster's node groups are matched to it by name and region, so a cluster of the same name in
another region gets none of their capabilities.

| Category | Capability | When |
|---|---|---|
| `compute.vm` or `compute.baremetal` (instance) | `ipv6` | a network interface has an IPv6 address |
| `compute.vm` or `compute.baremetal` (instance) | `snapshots` | one of its volumes has a snapshot you own |
| `compute.vm` (Auto Scaling group) | `autoscaling` | `MaxSize` is greater than `MinSize` |
| `compute.vm` (Auto Scaling group) | `zone-high-availability` | it spans two or more availability zones |
| `storage.block` | `encryption-at-rest` | `Encrypted` is true |
| `storage.block` | `snapshots` | the volume has a snapshot you own |
| `storage.object` | `encryption-at-rest` | always: S3 encrypts every bucket at rest |
| `storage.object` | `object-versioning` | versioning status is `Enabled` |
| `database.*` | `point-in-time-restore` | `BackupRetentionPeriod` is above 0 |
| `database.*` | `read-replicas` | it has read replicas |
| `database.*` | `zone-high-availability` | `MultiAZ` is true |
| `database.*` | `encryption-at-rest` | `StorageEncrypted` is true |
| `kubernetes.managed` | `autoscaling` | a managed node group's `maxSize` is above its `minSize` |
| `kubernetes.managed` | `node-high-availability` | its managed node groups want two or more nodes in all |
| `messaging.queue` | `dead-letter-queue` | it has a `RedrivePolicy` |
| `messaging.queue` | `encryption-at-rest` | SQS-managed or KMS server-side encryption is on |

### Everything else on AWS

The service calls above cover what the taxonomy classifies. Everything else (CloudFront
distributions, Route 53 zones, load balancers, and also networking and IAM resources) should show up
as `unclassified`, so the report shows what has no place to go. Two AWS services list everything:

- **AWS Config** (`configservice select-resource-config`, an SQL-like read-only query). Its
  `resourceType` is the CloudFormation type, the same convention as the table above, so the program
  reads it: every type the table does not cover becomes `unclassified`, and the types it does cover
  are dropped, as the service calls already list them. Config only knows what its recorder records,
  per region, and the recorder must be switched on by your administrator. With a Config aggregator,
  `select-aggregate-resource-config` queries every account and region at once; its output has the
  same shape.
- **Resource Explorer** (`resource-explorer-2 search` or `list-resources`) lists the resources of
  every region from one aggregator index, but names types its own way (`cloudfront:distribution`),
  not as CloudFormation types, so the program does not read it. It is still a quick way to see what
  an account holds; its index must be created by your administrator.

Without `config.json`, the inventory holds only the resources the service calls list.

## GCP

### GCP permissions

Prefer these roles on the project, each of which reads configuration only:

- `roles/cloudasset.viewer` (Cloud Asset Inventory, which also lists Bare Metal Solution servers:
  no Bare Metal Solution role is needed, as the program reads nothing more about them);
- `roles/compute.viewer` (instances, managed instance groups, snapshots);
- `roles/cloudsql.viewer` (Cloud SQL instances);
- `roles/container.clusterViewer` (GKE clusters);
- `roles/pubsub.viewer` (Pub/Sub subscriptions);
- `roles/storage.bucketViewer` (bucket metadata, with no access to the objects in them).

The simpler fallback is `roles/cloudasset.viewer` and the basic role `roles/viewer`, which covers
every call too but is broad: it reads the configuration of every service in the project, far more
than this page needs. The Cloud Asset API (`cloudasset.googleapis.com`) must be enabled on the project;
if it is not, ask your administrator to enable it.

### Collect from GCP

```bash
project=example-project   # your project ID
out=inventories/gcp
mkdir -p "$out"

# Keep only the two labels gcp.jq reads, not the values of any other label.
gcloud asset search-all-resources --scope="projects/$project" \
  --format='json(name,assetType,location,labels)' |
  jq '[.[] | if .labels then .labels |= with_entries(select(.key == "goog-gke-node" or .key == "goog-managed-by")) else . end]' \
  > "$out/assets.json"
gcloud compute instances list --project="$project" \
  --format='json(kind,selfLink,metadata.items[].key,disks[].source,disks[].boot,disks[].autoDelete,networkInterfaces[].stackType,networkInterfaces[].ipv6AccessConfigs[].type)' \
  > "$out/compute-instances.json"
gcloud compute instance-groups managed list --project="$project" \
  --format='json(kind,selfLink,status.autoscaler)' > "$out/compute-instance-groups.json"
gcloud compute snapshots list --project="$project" \
  --format='json(kind,sourceDisk)' > "$out/compute-snapshots.json"
gcloud sql instances list --project="$project" \
  --format='json(kind,selfLink,region,databaseVersion,replicaNames,settings.availabilityType,settings.backupConfiguration.pointInTimeRecoveryEnabled,settings.backupConfiguration.binaryLogEnabled)' \
  > "$out/sql-instances.json"
gcloud storage buckets list --project="$project" --raw \
  --format='json(kind,name,versioning)' > "$out/storage-buckets.json"
gcloud container clusters list --project="$project" \
  --format='json(selfLink,location,currentNodeCount,autopilot.enabled,nodePools[].autoscaling.enabled,nodePools[].instanceGroupUrls)' \
  > "$out/container-clusters.json"
gcloud pubsub subscriptions list --project="$project" \
  --format='json(name,deadLetterPolicy.deadLetterTopic)' > "$out/pubsub-subscriptions.json"
```

The `--format` projections keep only what the program reads: an instance's metadata keys, for
example, but not their values, which hold startup scripts and SSH keys, and of its disks only the
source, whether it boots and whether it is deleted with the instance (`autoDelete`). Of the asset
labels, `jq` keeps only `goog-gke-node` and `goog-managed-by`, the two the program reads.

The Cloud Asset Inventory listing is the list of resources; the other calls add the settings the
capabilities need. A resource the other calls do not cover still appears, as `unclassified` or
without capabilities. For several projects, collect each into a directory of its own and build one
inventory per project.

### Build the GCP inventory

```bash
jq -n -f docs/guide/inventory/gcp.jq inventories/gcp/*.json > inventories/gcp.inventory.json
```

Review `inventories/gcp.inventory.json`, then delete the raw output: `rm -r inventories/gcp`.

### GCP classification

The `rawType` is the resource's Cloud Asset Inventory asset type.

| `rawType` | Category |
|---|---|
| `compute.googleapis.com/Instance` | `compute.vm` |
| `compute.googleapis.com/InstanceGroupManager` | `compute.vm` |
| `baremetalsolution.googleapis.com/Instance` (Bare Metal Solution) | `compute.baremetal` |
| `compute.googleapis.com/Disk` | `storage.block` |
| `storage.googleapis.com/Bucket` | `storage.object` |
| `sqladmin.googleapis.com/Instance`, `databaseVersion` `POSTGRES_*` | `database.postgresql` |
| `sqladmin.googleapis.com/Instance`, `databaseVersion` `MYSQL_*` | `database.mysql` |
| `sqladmin.googleapis.com/Instance`, any other engine, or not in `sql instances list` | `unclassified` |
| `container.googleapis.com/Cluster` | `kubernetes.managed` |
| `cloudfunctions.googleapis.com/Function`, `cloudfunctions.googleapis.com/CloudFunction` | `serverless.function` |
| `pubsub.googleapis.com/Topic` | `messaging.queue` |
| `pubsub.googleapis.com/Subscription` | `messaging.queue` |
| `run.googleapis.com/Service` | `unclassified` |
| any other asset type | `unclassified` |

A Pub/Sub topic (where publishers write) and a subscription (where consumers read) are both listed,
as both have to move. Left out: instances a managed instance group created (metadata `created-by`;
the group stands for them) and the disks they delete with them (`disks[].autoDelete`, boot disk or
not), the nodes of a GKE cluster (the managed instance groups its node pools name in
`instanceGroupUrls`, and instances and disks labelled `goog-gke-node`; the cluster stands for them,
while a persistent volume's disk stays), the Cloud Run service behind a 2nd gen Cloud Function
(label `goog-managed-by: cloudfunctions`; the function stands for it), and snapshots and
autoscalers, which become capabilities of their disk or group. Any other Cloud Run service runs a
container, not a function, and stays `unclassified`.

| Category | Capability | When |
|---|---|---|
| `compute.vm` (instance) | `ipv6` | a network interface has stack type `IPV4_IPV6` or an IPv6 access config |
| `compute.vm` (managed instance group) | `autoscaling` | an autoscaler is attached (`status.autoscaler`) |
| `compute.vm` (managed instance group) | `zone-high-availability` | the group is regional |
| `storage.block` | `encryption-at-rest` | always: Google Cloud encrypts all data at rest |
| `storage.block` | `snapshots` | a snapshot's `sourceDisk` is the disk |
| `storage.object` | `encryption-at-rest` | always |
| `storage.object` | `object-versioning` | `versioning.enabled` is true |
| `database.*` | `encryption-at-rest` | always |
| `database.*` | `point-in-time-restore` | `pointInTimeRecoveryEnabled` is true, or for MySQL `binaryLogEnabled` |
| `database.*` | `zone-high-availability` | `availabilityType` is `REGIONAL` |
| `database.*` | `read-replicas` | `replicaNames` is not empty |
| `kubernetes.managed` | `zone-high-availability` | the cluster is regional |
| `kubernetes.managed` | `node-high-availability` | it runs two or more nodes |
| `kubernetes.managed` | `autoscaling` | Autopilot, or a node pool with autoscaling |
| `messaging.queue` (subscription) | `dead-letter-queue` | it has a dead-letter topic |

## Azure

### Azure permissions

The built-in `Reader` role on the subscription. It covers Resource Graph and the management-plane
reads below (Service Bus queues and topics, storage queues, blob service properties); none of the
commands reads a storage account key or any data.

### Collect from Azure

Resource Graph returns at most 1,000 rows per call, so the loop below fetches page after page until
no skip token is left. It reads the subscription the CLI is set to (`az account show`):

```bash
subscription="$(az account show --query id --output tsv)"
out=inventories/azure
mkdir -p "$out"

# Keep only the properties azure.jq reads, and only for the types it reads them from.

The query keeps no admin user names, SSH keys, server logins or host names. It keeps whole arrays
where the program reads one field of each element (a virtual machine's data disks and network
interfaces, a network interface's IP configurations with their private IP addresses, an AKS
cluster's node pools with their labels, tags (keys and values), taints, subnet IDs and node image
versions), as Resource Graph cannot trim inside an array.

Resource Graph holds most settings; Service Bus queues and topics, storage queues and a storage
account's blob versioning are not in it, hence the three loops. Storage queues are listed through the
Resource Manager API (`az rest --method get`, a read), not the data plane, so `Reader` is enough and
no account key is needed. A Basic tier Service Bus namespace has no topics, and its `topic list`
fails: that error is expected. An account with more queues than one response returns adds a
`nextLink` to the response; run that call without `--query` and fetch the `nextLink` URL with
`az rest --method get --url` as well.

### Build the Azure inventory

```bash
jq -n -f docs/guide/inventory/azure.jq inventories/azure/*.json > inventories/azure.inventory.json
```

Review `inventories/azure.inventory.json`, then delete the raw output: `rm -r inventories/azure`.

### Azure classification

The `rawType` is the resource's Azure Resource Manager type, taken from its resource ID (Resource
Graph writes types in lower case).

| `rawType` | Category |
|---|---|
| `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines` | `compute.vm` |
| `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets` | `compute.vm` |
| `Microsoft.BareMetalInfrastructure/bareMetalInstances` (BareMetal Infrastructure) | `compute.baremetal` |
| `Microsoft.AzureLargeInstance/azureLargeInstances` (SAP HANA Large Instances) | `compute.baremetal` |
| `Microsoft.Compute/disks` | `storage.block` |
| `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts` (not kind `FileStorage`) | `storage.object` |
| `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts`, kind `FileStorage` | `unclassified` |
| `Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers` | `database.postgresql` |
| `Microsoft.DBforMySQL/flexibleServers` | `database.mysql` |
| `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters` | `kubernetes.managed` |
| `Microsoft.Web/sites`, kind `functionapp` | `serverless.function` |
| `Microsoft.Web/sites`, any other kind (web app, Logic App) | `unclassified` |
| `Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/queues` | `messaging.queue` |
| `Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/topics` | `unclassified` |
| `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/queueServices/queues` | `messaging.queue` |
| any other type | `unclassified` |

A Service Bus topic, where every subscription gets its own copy of a message, is publish and
subscribe, which no taxonomy category covers: each topic is listed as `unclassified` under its own
name, so the report shows it as a blocker.

Left out: virtual machines of a scale set, their OS disks (`storageProfile.osDisk`) and their data
disks created with `deleteOption: Delete` (the scale set stands for them), snapshots and autoscale
settings, which become capabilities of their disk or scale set, a Service Bus namespace whose queues
or topics are listed (they stand for it; a namespace with neither stays `unclassified`), and
everything in an AKS cluster's node resource group (`properties.nodeResourceGroup`, usually
`MC_<group>_<cluster>_<region>`): the node pools' scale sets, load balancers, public IP addresses
and network interfaces, which AKS manages and the cluster stands for. A managed disk in that group
is a persistent volume that holds data, and stays.

| Category | Capability | When |
|---|---|---|
| `compute.vm` (virtual machine) | `ipv6` | a network interface has an IPv6 IP configuration |
| `compute.vm` (virtual machine) | `snapshots` | one of its managed disks has a snapshot |
| `compute.vm` (scale set) | `autoscaling` | an enabled autoscale setting targets it |
| `compute.vm` (scale set) | `zone-high-availability` | it spans two or more zones |
| `storage.block` | `encryption-at-rest` | always: Azure encrypts every managed disk |
| `storage.block` | `snapshots` | a snapshot was taken from the disk |
| `storage.object` | `encryption-at-rest` | always: Azure encrypts every storage account |
| `storage.object` | `object-versioning` | blob versioning is enabled |
| `database.*` | `encryption-at-rest` | always |
| `database.*` | `point-in-time-restore` | `backupRetentionDays` is above 0 |
| `database.*` | `zone-high-availability` | high availability mode `ZoneRedundant` |
| `database.*` | `node-high-availability` | high availability mode `SameZone` |
| `database.*` | `read-replicas` | another server names it as its source |
| `kubernetes.managed` | `autoscaling` | a node pool has autoscaling on |
| `kubernetes.managed` | `zone-high-availability` | a node pool spans two or more zones |
| `kubernetes.managed` | `node-high-availability` | its node pools run two or more nodes in all |
| `messaging.queue` (Service Bus) | `dead-letter-queue` | always: every Service Bus queue has a dead-letter subqueue |
| `messaging.queue` (storage queue) | `encryption-at-rest` | always: Azure encrypts every storage account |

## Trim what you do not want assessed

The full listings include supporting resources, such as networks, network interfaces, security
groups and IAM roles, and each becomes an `unclassified` blocker. To drop the unclassified resources
of a type, filter the inventory with `jq`; for example, every Azure networking resource:

```bash
jq 'del(.resources[] | select(.category == "unclassified" and (.rawType | startswith("Microsoft.Network/"))))' \
  inventories/azure.inventory.json > inventories/azure-trimmed.inventory.json
```

Edit the file by hand as well: it is plain JSON. Leave out only what really has nothing to move.

## Privacy

An inventory holds the names and IDs of resources in a real account. The programs keep it as small as
they can (short IDs, no account, project or subscription field), but names can still say a lot about
a business.

The collected directory under `inventories/<source>/` says far more. It is the providers' raw output:
even trimmed to the fields the programs read, it holds full ARNs and resource IDs with the account,
project or subscription, and it can hold IP addresses, tag keys, labels and settings, and, if you
drop a `--query` or `--format` projection, secrets such as function environment variables or startup
scripts.

- Share only the reviewed inventory file, never the collected directory.
- Delete the collected directory right after the build (`rm -r inventories/<source>`).
- Keep short IDs. Do not replace them with ARNs, full GCP resource names or Azure resource IDs, which
  carry the account, project or subscription ID.
- Review the file before you share it, and rename anything that should not leave your organisation.
- `shift2eu assess` runs offline: it reads the file and writes a report, and sends nothing anywhere.
- Never commit an inventory or the raw CLI output from a real account to a repository. In a clone of
  this one, `inventories/` and `*.inventory.json` are git-ignored; its fixtures are sanitised by rule.

## Validate the result

Assess the inventory against every target:

```bash
shift2eu assess --inventory inventories/aws.inventory.json --target all
```

`assess` refuses a file it cannot read exactly, with exit code 1 and one line that names the file
and the field by its path, for example:

```text
shift2eu: load inventory: inventory file "inventories/aws.inventory.json": not a valid inventory document: unknown key "regoin" at "resources[0].regoin", line 1, column 82
shift2eu: load inventory: inventory file "inventories/aws.inventory.json": resource "i-0123456789abcdef0": unknown taxonomy category "compute.mv"
shift2eu: load inventory: inventory file "inventories/aws.inventory.json": resources[1]: duplicate resource ID "a"
```

It also refuses a file over 10 MiB, more than 50,000 resources and more than 32 capabilities on one
resource; split a larger estate into several inventories, by region or project. After a hand edit,
check the category and capability names against the lists above. [Assess an inventory](assess.md)
describes the report and the exit codes, and [Try it](try-it.md#read-the-report) how to read it.
