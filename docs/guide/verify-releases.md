# Verify a release

Every published image is signed and carries build provenance and an SBOM, and every release archive
carries build provenance. This page shows how to check all three for an image before you run it, inside
the project's Lima VM too, how to check a release archive against its checksums and its provenance, and
how to verify the releases published before the project's rename.

## Verify the image

Every published image is signed with [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign), keyless, by the
release workflow's GitHub identity for that tag, and carries build provenance and an SPDX SBOM as
GitHub attestations. You need cosign v3 or later, which reads the signature from the registry in the
bundle format the release writes, and the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). The release
workflow's `verify` job runs these same checks on every release, on a fresh GitHub-hosted runner with
read-only permissions, and fails the release when one fails. It runs after the images are published, so
it detects a bad release rather than prevents one; run the checks yourself before you trust an image.

A tag can be moved; a digest cannot. Resolve the release tag to its digest once, then verify and run
that digest:

```bash
TAG=v0.2.0
DIGEST="$(docker buildx imagetools inspect "ghcr.io/timothymamo/shift2eu:$TAG" --format '{{.Manifest.Digest}}')"
IMAGE="ghcr.io/timothymamo/shift2eu@$DIGEST"

# The signature: made by release.yml, run on a push of exactly this tag.
cosign verify "$IMAGE" \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/timothymamo/shift2eu/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/$TAG" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-github-workflow-trigger push

# The build provenance (SLSA), then the SBOM: from release.yml, for this tag, on GitHub's runners.
gh attestation verify "oci://$IMAGE" --repo timothymamo/shift2eu \
  --signer-workflow timothymamo/shift2eu/.github/workflows/release.yml \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/$TAG" --deny-self-hosted-runners
gh attestation verify "oci://$IMAGE" --repo timothymamo/shift2eu \
  --signer-workflow timothymamo/shift2eu/.github/workflows/release.yml \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/$TAG" --deny-self-hosted-runners \
  --predicate-type https://spdx.dev/Document/v2.3

docker run --rm "$IMAGE" version
```

Inside the project's Lima VM, which has rootless nerdctl and no Docker
([ADR 0017](../adr/0017-run-a-rootless-container-runtime-in-the-lima-vm.md)), resolve the digest with
[crane](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/cmd/crane), which reads only the
index and pulls nothing, and run with `nerdctl`; the `cosign` and `gh` commands are the same:

```bash
# Replaces the DIGEST= line and the final `docker run` line above; TAG, IMAGE, cosign and gh stay as they are.
DIGEST="$(crane digest "ghcr.io/timothymamo/shift2eu:$TAG")"
nerdctl run --rm --read-only --network none "$IMAGE" version
```

Each platform's image is signed too, so `cosign verify` also accepts the `linux/amd64` or
`linux/arm64` digest that `docker buildx imagetools inspect` lists. `gh attestation verify ...
--format json` prints the attested statements, the SBOM's packages among them. The SBOM is attested
on the index digest but generated from its `linux/amd64` image; the `linux/arm64` image is built from
the same source, Go modules and distroless base (`crane digest --platform linux/arm64 ...` prints one
platform's digest). The image's labels
name the source repository (`org.opencontainers.image.source`) and the commit
(`org.opencontainers.image.revision`).

## Verify an archive

The release archives, the CLI's `shift2eu_*` and the HTTP API's `shift2eu-server_*`
([Install](install.md#the-release-archives)), are listed in one `checksums.txt`, published with the
release, as is the OpenAPI document `shift2eu-server_openapi.json`, checked against it the same way with
its name in place of the archive's. Each archive and `checksums.txt` itself carry GitHub build provenance, attested by the release
workflow for its tag, before the release is published (issue #163). The digest check alone detects a
download corrupted in transit or on a mirror; the attestation adds who built the file: `release.yml`,
run on a push of exactly that tag, from that commit, on GitHub's runners. Whoever could replace an
archive and its `checksums.txt` cannot make that attestation. The release is published only if it
holds exactly `checksums.txt` and the archives it lists, each with the digest it records, and the
release published is the draft that was checked. The release workflow's `verify-archives` job then
runs these checks on every asset of every release, on a fresh runner with read-only permissions, and
fails the release when one fails. Check either archive the same way, with `TAG` set to the release you
want:

```bash
TAG=vX.Y.Z
VERSION="${TAG#v}"
ARCHIVE="shift2eu_${VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz"   # the HTTP API's: shift2eu-server_${VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz

gh release download "$TAG" --repo timothymamo/shift2eu --pattern "$ARCHIVE" --pattern checksums.txt
awk -v a="$ARCHIVE" '$2 == a' checksums.txt > "$ARCHIVE.sha256"
sha256sum --check "$ARCHIVE.sha256"   # macOS: shasum -a 256 --check "$ARCHIVE.sha256"

# The build provenance (SLSA): from release.yml, for this tag, on GitHub's runners.
gh attestation verify "$ARCHIVE" --repo timothymamo/shift2eu \
  --signer-workflow timothymamo/shift2eu/.github/workflows/release.yml \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/$TAG" --deny-self-hosted-runners
tar -xzf "$ARCHIVE"
```

`awk` copies the line of `checksums.txt` whose name is exactly the archive's, and the check must print
`<archive>: OK`. A wrong digest prints `FAILED` and exits non-zero; a name missing from `checksums.txt`
leaves the copied file empty, which fails the check too (non-zero exit, no `OK`) instead of checking
nothing. `gh attestation verify` must print `✓ Verification succeeded!` and exits non-zero otherwise.
It works the same on macOS. `gh attestation verify checksums.txt ...`, with the same flags, verifies
`checksums.txt` itself. On Windows, in PowerShell, for a `.zip` archive:

```powershell
$Tag = "vX.Y.Z"
$Archive = "shift2eu_$($Tag.TrimStart('v'))_windows_amd64.zip"   # the HTTP API's: shift2eu-server_...
gh release download $Tag --repo timothymamo/shift2eu --pattern $Archive --pattern checksums.txt
$Want = @(Get-Content checksums.txt | Where-Object { $_.EndsWith("  $Archive") })
if ($Want.Count -ne 1) { throw "$Archive is not in checksums.txt exactly once" }
if ((Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 $Archive).Hash -ne $Want[0].Split(' ')[0]) { throw "$Archive does not match checksums.txt" }   # -ne ignores case
gh attestation verify $Archive --repo timothymamo/shift2eu `
  --signer-workflow timothymamo/shift2eu/.github/workflows/release.yml `
  --source-ref "refs/tags/$Tag" --deny-self-hosted-runners
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw "$Archive has no build provenance from release.yml for $Tag" }
Expand-Archive $Archive
```

Each archive holds only its own binary (`shift2eu` or `shift2eu-server`, `.exe` on Windows), with
`README.md`, `LICENSE` and the Markdown pages under `docs/`. The `shift2eu-server_*` archives start
with the first release after `v0.2.0`: `v0.2.0` and earlier shipped the CLI only, in `shift2eu_*`.
The archives' attestations start with the first release after `v0.3.0`: for `v0.3.0` and earlier,
only the digest check applies, and `checksums.txt` comes from the same release as the archive, so it
cannot tell a compromised release from a sound one; run the signed image instead where that matters.

## Releases before the rename: v0.1.0 and v0.1.0-rc.1

The project was called `eu-sov-cloud` until v0.2.0
([ADR 0020](../adr/0020-rename-the-project-to-shift2eu.md)). `v0.1.0` and `v0.1.0-rc.1` keep the
names they were published with: binaries `eusov_*`, image `ghcr.io/timothymamo/eusov`, and the
signing identity of the repository's old name. Verify them with the commands above, with these
changes:

```bash
TAG=v0.1.0   # or v0.1.0-rc.1
DIGEST="$(docker buildx imagetools inspect "ghcr.io/timothymamo/eusov:$TAG" --format '{{.Manifest.Digest}}')"
IMAGE="ghcr.io/timothymamo/eusov@$DIGEST"

cosign verify "$IMAGE" \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/timothymamo/eu-sov-cloud/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/$TAG" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-github-workflow-trigger push

gh attestation verify "oci://$IMAGE" --repo timothymamo/eu-sov-cloud \
  --signer-workflow timothymamo/eu-sov-cloud/.github/workflows/release.yml \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/$TAG" --deny-self-hosted-runners
```

Add `--predicate-type https://spdx.dev/Document/v2.3` to the `gh attestation verify` line for the
SBOM, as above. GitHub redirects the old repository name to the new one.
