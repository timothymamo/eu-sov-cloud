# Repository layout

Where everything lives in the repository: the two composition roots, the hexagon's layers under
`internal/`, the repository-wide tests under `test/`, the documentation, and the files that set up the
agents' environment. [Architecture](../architecture.md) explains why it is laid out this way.
