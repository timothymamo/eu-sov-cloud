// These tests pin the two rules of issue #195 on probe sources under testdata
// (their .go.txt names, not .go, keep the go command, golangci-lint and
// test/lint's own scan of every Go file under test/ away from them, and keep
// the environ probes from tripping that scan). Each probe states one way an
// e2e test could hand a child the whole environment of the test process, where
// the agents' keys and tokens live (CLAUDE.md rule 3), or read it without a
// child. test/lint runs the checkers over the repository in
// TestE2ETestsSetExecEnv and TestTestTreeNamesNoProcEnviron.
//
// The rule fails closed: a command the checker cannot follow, a use of it it
// cannot vouch for, and an import it cannot name are findings too. Each probe
// below is one such shape, and the accepted ones are the shapes the tier really
// writes.
//
// A finding's line is the line a reader fixes: the Run, Start, Output or
// CombinedOutput call for CheckExecEnv, the construction, type, assignment or
// import that hands the command on, and the literal for CheckEnvironLiterals.
// Its message is not pinned, only that it says something, so the wording can
// change without touching a probe.
//
// A shape yields at most one finding per line, at the earliest statement a
// reader fixes, even where two rules of the checker meet on it: an exec.Cmd
// composite literal with no Env is refused once as a literal and once as the
// command type it names, and the probe expects the one finding. An Env assigned
// a value that inherits the environment is a finding at the assignment and
// leaves the command's Env unset, so a run after it is a finding too, on its own
// line.

// noExemption refuses no command name, the exemption function of a caller that
// lets nothing inherit the environment.

// flags, so a probe shows that a subcommand the source does not write as a
