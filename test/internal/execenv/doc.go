// Package execenv holds the exec environment rules of issue #195, with the
// standard library only: the rules that keep the e2e tier's _test.go files, and
// every Go file under test/, from reading the whole environment of the test
// process, where the agents' keys and tokens live (CLAUDE.md rule 3).
//
// CheckExecEnv parses one Go source file and refuses every way an *exec.Cmd
// may start with a nil Env, which exec.Cmd reads as "inherit the whole
// environment of this process"; whatever the child prints from it can reach a
// t.Log call or a golden file. It fails closed: apart from the four gaps
// below, a shape it cannot follow is a finding. It follows a command only
// when exec.Command or exec.CommandContext builds it as the whole right-hand
// side of a statement inside a function that declares the name it binds
// (`ident :=` or `var ident =`), keyed by the variable that identifier
// declares (go/types, with every import an empty package), so a shadowing name
// cannot mask it. A construction bound any other way (to a name that exists
// already or is declared in another file, a call argument, a composite
// element, a struct field, a chained run) is a finding, and so are a followed
// name rebound to anything but a new construction and exec.Command or
// exec.CommandContext used as a function value. A file reports at most one
// finding per line, at the earliest statement a reader fixes.
//
// Until its Env is set, the command may only have fields assigned
// (`ident.<Field> = ...`, through parentheses and `*` too); a Run, Start,
// Output or CombinedOutput call, an alias, an argument, a method value or
// expression and a capture in a function literal are each a finding. Every
// Env assignment, whatever its receiver (a followed command, a parameter, an
// alias, a value copy, a struct field, a type-switch variable), and every Env
// key of a composite literal of any type, takes only a value the check proves
// is not nil: a composite literal, a make call, an append of such a value, or
// a call to a function of the same file, with no named result and no defer
// statement, whose every return is one of those. Any other value (nil,
// []string(nil), a variable, a reslice, *new([]string), one of a call's
// several results, a range statement's) is a finding and leaves Env unset, and
// a helper with a named result or a defer is refused at its declaration. Once
// the command has been aliased, stored, passed, captured, deferred or handed
// to a go statement, any Env assigned to it is a finding, and the address of
// any Env field is a finding wherever it appears.
//
// Every type expression naming exec.Cmd that is not the operand of a `*` is
// refused (a value variable, field, array, embedded field, alias, defined
// type, type argument, new(exec.Cmd)), as is an embedded *exec.Cmd: a command
// value no exec.Command built has a nil Env. The one exception is an exec.Cmd
// composite literal whose Env key holds a proven value. A *exec.Cmd is
// accepted only as the whole type of a struct field, a parameter, a result, a
// var, a type assertion or a type-switch case, since a nil pointer runs
// nothing; as the element or key of an array, slice, map or chan type, on the
// right of a type declaration or as a type argument it is refused: no array,
// slice, map or chan element type is a *exec.Cmd, so no elided literal can
// build one; a command reaches a struct field only through a use the check
// vouches for. A generic function, which could build or hold one the check
// cannot follow, is refused in a file that imports os/exec, and so is a blank
// or dot import of os/exec, which hides the commands the check follows. In a
// file that imports os/exec, an import of reflect or unsafe is refused at its
// import line, one finding per line: reflection can build a command with a nil
// Env (reflect.New) or reset a followed command's Env (FieldByName("Env")),
// and unsafe reaches the Env field by offset, both out of the check's sight.
// The refusal is per file: a file that imports no os/exec has its reflect or
// unsafe import pass, and a command handed to it from a sibling file falls
// under the third gap below. A finding names the line a reader fixes, and
// says nothing about how far the child's output travels, which no source
// check can see.
//
// The caller's exempt function is handed the command name and the argument
// after it, both only when they are string literals, and the string-literal
// arguments after that in source order; a command it admits may run with no
// Env, once bound to a variable (a run chained to the construction is always
// refused). test/lint admits `go build` and `go list`, which need the
// environment and print none of it, and only while every literal flag is one
// of its allow-list, e2eToolchainFlags (-trimpath, -o, -deps), so a flag the
// go command gains later is refused until review adds it. The checker itself
// takes the exemption away from a spread argument and on an assignment to
// Path or Args.
//
// Four gaps are accepted, and review holds them:
//   - Flow-insensitivity: the check follows the source, not the flow, so an
//     Env assigned anywhere before a use counts, in a branch that never runs
//     (`if false { cmd.Env = ... }`) or in a closure too, as forbidigo's
//     e2e-no-env group accepts its embedded-type gap.
//   - Paths built at run time are beyond CheckEnvironLiterals, a rule of
//     literals (below).
//   - A command built in, or handed to, another file or package is out of the
//     file's sight: a decoder such as json.Unmarshal, or a helper of a sibling
//     file of test/e2e that imports reflect but not os/exec, may write Env
//     through a command that has escaped into it.
//   - A non-literal argument to an exempt toolchain command that holds a flag
//     keeps the exemption: only literals are checked against the allow-list.
//     A Dir set on an exempt command keeps the exemption too: the go command
//     then reads that directory's go.mod and go.work, which a planted
//     toolchain line could abuse, and that is left to review as well.
//
// CheckEnvironLiterals refuses the string literals of a file that name the
// environment of a process, which reads it without starting a child, under one
// of two tiers. TierE2E, for test/e2e, which holds no fixture literals,
// refuses a literal with a proc or dev/fd path segment (EnvironmentPathIn).
// TierTest, for the rest of test/, where a probe's source and an expected
// message are literals of their own, refuses a literal whose value, after
// path.Clean, is a /proc/.../environ path at any depth and with any number of
// leading slashes or none. A literal is read as the compiler reads it, a raw
// one too, and one that does not unquote is skipped; comments are no literals.
// A path built at run time (filepath.Join, concatenation, fmt.Sprintf,
// os.DirFS("/proc").Open(...)) is beyond a rule of literals: review holds it,
// and in test/e2e forbidigo's e2e-no-env.
//
// EnvironmentPathIn is the segment matcher both test/lint's composition-root
// rule and the e2e tier share. Its test, environmentpath_test.go, reads the
// paths it pins from a JSON file under testdata, so it holds no path literal
// and TestTestTreeNamesNoProcEnviron scans it like every other Go file.
//
// test/lint runs both rules over the repository, in TestE2ETestsSetExecEnv,
// which walks test/e2e recursively, and TestTestTreeNamesNoProcEnviron; their
// probes are the .go.txt files of this package's testdata, which no build
// compiles and the second scan never meets. It lives here rather than in
// test/lint because test/lint holds doc.go and _test.go files only, under the
// strict test-docs-are-pure depguard rule, as the shellcheck rule of issue
// #177 does.
