// repository's build, cut down to the keys Read reads. The build has one
// build, the environment Env names (CGO_ENABLED=0, GOWORK=off and
// GOFLAGS=-mod=readonly, in that order; issue #102), and three goos by two
// goarch: six platforms, which is the list every case below compares against
// or breaks. A document with a before section carries the one hook Read
// accepts, `go mod tidy -diff`: it fails and writes nothing when the module is
// not tidy, where plain `go mod tidy` would rewrite go.mod and go.sum before
// the -mod=readonly build.
//
// buildFlow and buildReal live in testdata, as files: the tests of
// test/architecture/internal/check add a release section to the same two
// documents, so there is one copy of each to keep in step with the release.
