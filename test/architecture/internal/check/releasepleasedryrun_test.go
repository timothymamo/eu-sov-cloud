// ciReleasePleaseDryRun is the part of .github/workflows/ci.yml that
// check.ReleasePleaseDryRun pins (issue #142): the workflow runs on a
// pull_request and on a push to main, GITHUB_TOKEN only reads, and one job runs
// .github/scripts/release-please-dry-run.sh, which reads the release-please
// workflow's guard and tag steps and runs their scripts against a fake gh. The
// dry run reaches no network, writes nothing and needs no credential, so the
// job holds no write permission and no secret.

// cannot reach the repository or the network with anything but a read.
