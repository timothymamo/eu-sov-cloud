// GitHubRelease checks how a .goreleaser.yaml document publishes the GitHub
// release: its top-level release section must hold exactly draft: true,
// prerelease: auto and replace_existing_draft: true, in that order.
//
//   - draft: true (issue #156): goreleaser uploads every asset to a draft and
//     leaves it a draft, and release.yml's publish job publishes it last,
//     after the archives are attested. A published release whose repository
//     has release immutability on can then never gain or lose an asset (ADR
//     0015). goreleaser's default publishes the release itself, as soon as
//     its own uploads are done.
//   - prerelease: auto (issue #92): goreleaser marks a tag with a pre-release
//     suffix (v0.1.0-rc.2) as a GitHub pre-release, which never becomes the
//     latest release, and a plain vX.Y.Z as a normal release, as the image
//     gets no X.Y and no latest tag for a pre-release (ADR 0015).
//   - replace_existing_draft: true: a re-run of a failed goreleaser job
//     deletes the draft the failed run left for the tag and starts a new one,
//     rather than leave two drafts for one tag. GitHub's release by tag
//     (GetReleaseByTag) skips drafts, so without it goreleaser creates a
//     second one, and the publish job may publish the incomplete first.
//
// It fails closed: a missing release section is refused, because goreleaser's
// default publishes every tag as a normal release, and so is any other key or
// value in it: make_latest, for one, would override what prerelease: auto
// decides, and draft: false would publish assets that could no longer change
// before they are attested.
