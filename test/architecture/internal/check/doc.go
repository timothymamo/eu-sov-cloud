// Package check holds the package-level architecture checks that
// test/architecture runs against this repository (issue #40, ADR 0012).
//
// The checks work on packages, not file names. ListPackages lists packages and
// every package they depend on with go list, for one release platform, with
// cgo off or on and with a set of build tags, in an environment built from an
// allow list so that nothing outside its arguments changes the listing.
// Packages holds each package of the module to the allow list of every
// depguard rule whose directory covers it and does not exclude it, and, for a
// rule that holds test files, the imports of its _test.go files too (issue
// #79). A rule whose files: list names the test files of a directory alone
// (the pair **/<dir>/**/*_test.go and **/<dir>/*_test.go, RuleFiles.TestsOnly)
// holds only those imports (issue #144); a package held by such rules alone is
// reported, since then no rule holds its own imports. AllowList follows a deny
// list written as an alias of another rule's anchor. An import is matched as depguard v2.2.1 matches it: the entries are
// sorted as written and only the one nearest before the import decides, exact
// for an entry ending in $, by string prefix for one ending in /. AllowList
// refuses a prefix entry that does not end in /, and a rule whose deny list
// names a path its allow list allows, since depguard then decides by entry
// length. A third-party package that in-module packages import only where a
// strict rule holds and allows the import, and everything it imports that no
// in-module package imports directly, is exempt: depguard lints no file of a
// dependency. Any other package outside the module that the layers reach is
// reported. The exemption reads the strict allow lists only: the lax deny
// rules (go-cmp-only-in-tests, cloud-sdks-only-in-provider-adapters) are held
// by depguard in make lint alone. A third-party import in internal/cli is
// refused by depguard alone, whose strict rule allows only $gostd and named
// module packages. One in cmd/shift2eu is refused by the strict rule
// composition-root (issue #101), which the architecture tests hold the
// composition root to with Packages, apart from the shared layer listing.
// The exemption trusts the import path, which is sound because the root
// go.mod holds no replace directive, read with the go command's own parser
// (TestRootModuleHasNoReplace), and the repository holds no go.work,
// go.work.sum or vendor directory (TestRepositoryHasNoWorkspaceOrVendor), any
// of which could otherwise substitute code for an allowed import path. A
// package only a test imports is not listed by go list -deps, so it is not
// placed itself. Sources holds every package of the module, layer or not, to
// the rules that do not depend on a rule: it must belong to the main module,
// sit in the directory its import path names with symlinks resolved, and hold
// no cgo, C, assembly or other non-Go source.
// FindLineDirectives reports every line directive in a Go file git tracks or
// would add under a root, and every symlink among those files.
// StrayReleaseFiles and ReleaseWorkflow pin that the release builds what the
// check lists: no other goreleaser document, go.work or vendor at the root that
// git could commit, and a release workflow read as a closed schema of one
// release at a time and twelve jobs: the tests, behind the guard that the
// tagged commit is on main; a goreleaser job that runs no repository code,
// sets no environment for the go command, uploads to a draft release and hands
// the archives on as a workflow artifact; an attest-archives job that attests
// every archive and checksums.txt with GitHub build provenance and cannot
// write the repository; a publish job, contents: write alone, that publishes
// the draft last (issues #156, #163); and, for each of the two images, the
// CLI's and the HTTP API's (PRD #103), an image job that builds and pushes the
// image and can do nothing more, an sbom job that can only read the registry,
// and a sign job, the only one with an OIDC token, that signs and attests the
// image by digest with sigstore's and GitHub's actions alone; and a verify job
// on a fresh runner, read-only to the registry and the attestations, with no
// OIDC token and no checkout, that verifies both published images by digest
// and the tag rule (issue #99), and a verify-archives job beside it, as
// read-only, that verifies the published archives' digests and attestations
// (issue #163). WorkflowPrivileges keeps every other
// workflow from publishing: no packages, id-token or attestations write, no
// write-all, no trigger a tag runs (push of tags, create, release,
// workflow_run), and a top-level permissions: always. DryRunMirrorsRelease
// holds ci.yml's image job, the release's dry run, to the release's build
// settings for each image, tag rules, latest decision, SBOM settings, action
// pins and BuildKit image, and to the verify job's container run of each
// image.
//
// ReleasePleaseWorkflow and ReleasePleaseConfig hold the workflow that
// proposes the next release, .github/workflows/release-please.yml, and the
// document it reads, release-please-config.json, to issues #142, #157 and
// #159 (ADR 0021). The workflow runs on a push to main alone, with
// permissions: {} at the top level, job permissions that only read, and a
// concurrency group of its own that never cancels a run in progress; it runs
// only the App token action and release-please, pinned by commit, on
// ubuntu-latest alone, in three jobs. The release-please job, in the
// release-please environment, mints the release-please App's token with
// exactly Contents and Pull requests write and runs release-please with it.
// The tag job, in the release-tag environment, mints the release-tag App's
// token with exactly Contents write and Pull requests read, waits with
// GITHUB_TOKEN for no release.yml run to be requested, waiting, pending,
// queued or in progress, and creates the tag through the API in a step whose
// env: is exactly that token, the repository and the release-please App's
// slug as a constant, never an output of the release-please job, which
// declares none, and which calls only the release PR's, the manifest's, the
// merge commit's and the tag's API endpoints: no Release, no label, no gh
// release, no curl. The guard's env: is as exact: GITHUB_TOKEN, the
// repository and the same slug. The relabel job, in the release-please
// environment, relabels the PR the tag job tagged with the release-please
// App's token. Each token step passes client-id, never app-id, from its own
// App's variable and secret; no other variable or secret is read, and each
// token reaches its job's working step alone. The only needs expressions are
// the tag job's two outputs, which the relabel job reads. The workflow
// publishes nothing and pastes no expression but github.repository into a
// script.
// ReleaseAppIdentifiers holds the two documents that record the release Apps'
// identifiers, the release-tag skill and ADR 0021, to each other: the same
// release-please App ID and slug, and for the release-tag App either the
// maintainer's placeholders or a numeric ID and a slug, neither of them the
// release-please App's.
// ReleasePleaseDryRun holds ci.yml to running the dry run of the guard, tag
// and relabel steps, .github/scripts/release-please-dry-run.sh, on every pull
// request and every push to main, in a job with no write permission and no
// secret.
// The configuration holds the release-tag
// skill's version rules, vX.Y.Z tags with no component,
// skip-github-release, no key that could move the version or the tag
// unreviewed, and one package at the repository root.
//
// GitHubRelease holds the release section of .goreleaser.yaml to exactly
// draft: true, prerelease: auto and replace_existing_draft: true, so every
// asset is uploaded to a draft that release.yml publishes last (issue #156),
// and a pre-release tag is a GitHub pre-release and never the latest release
// (issue #92), and one extra file, the bundled OpenAPI document
// ./api/openapi.bundled.json published as the asset
// shift2eu-server_openapi.json (issue #139).
//
// GoReleaserArchives and DryRunVerifiesArchives hold the release to shipping
// each binary in archives of its own, under one tag and version (issue #147).
// GoReleaserArchives reads the archives: section of .goreleaser.yaml as a
// closed schema: two entries, each with an id: equal to the one build its
// ids: names, no two with the same id, the CLI's archive keeping its name
// shift2eu_<version>_<os>_<arch> and the server's shift2eu-server_<version>_
// <os>_<arch>, both tar.gz (zip on Windows) with LICENSE, README.md and docs/,
// and one checksums.txt covering every archive and the bundled OpenAPI
// document, the same single extra_files entry release: holds (issue #139).
// DryRunVerifiesArchives holds
// ci.yml's test job to one step running .github/scripts/verify-archives.sh,
// which builds a goreleaser snapshot and fails unless each archive holds
// exactly its own binary, after one goreleaser-action step that installs
// (install-only) the GoReleaser release.yml's goreleaser job runs: the same
// commit, distribution and version.
//
// Nothing is copied: the release platforms are read from .goreleaser.yaml
// (releasetarget.Read, in test/internal/releasetarget, which test/lint reads
// them with too; ListPackages takes a releasetarget.Target), and the strict
// rules and their allow lists from .golangci.yml (StrictRules, RuleDirs,
// AllowList). These files and the workflows are read with the standard
// library, by the strict line reader of test/internal/yamlread, keyed on
// indentation, that refuses what it does not expect, and the characters YAML
// readers do not agree on, rather than guess at them.
//
// DepguardRules reads every depguard rule of .golangci.yml whole, and
// PinnedRules compares those rules with a pinned copy, naming the rule of every
// difference (issue #80).
//
// HidingSettings reads .golangci.yml for the settings that hide issues from
// make lint without touching a rule, and the ways of turning depguard or
// forbidigo off, and returns one message per setting found, naming it by its
// dotted key (issue #81). The document's shape is an allow list that fails
// closed: version must be "2", and a top-level, run, linters,
// linters.exclusions or issues key, a linters.default or a
// linters.exclusions.presets entry it does not know is refused. It wants
// linters.exclusions.generated: disable, which golangci-lint reads as lax when
// it is absent, and refuses a run.issues-exit-code outside 1..125, Go's
// portable exit range: os.Exit truncates the code to 8 bits, so 256 exits 0
// while lint prints issues. StrayLintConfigs refuses
// a .golangci.json, .golangci.toml or .golangci.yaml at the root that git
// could commit, any of which golangci-lint would read in place of
// .golangci.yml.
//
// NonExecutableScripts lists every file in the git index under a directory
// whose staged content starts with #! and whose mode is 100644, reading
// both from the index with git ls-files -s and git cat-file --batch (issue #125).
//
// The package is internal to test/architecture: it is not an API of the module.
