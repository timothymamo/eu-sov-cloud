// The saved-page rule and its allow list live in savedpages_rule_test.go
// (issue #212): a saved price page, a browser copy of a target's pricing page
// kept because the site refuses automated clients, belongs in a scratch
// directory outside the repository and is never committed. Committing one
// would put a large third-party page, tracking scripts and session data
// included, next to a catalog snapshot. The convention is stated in
// internal/adapter/target/upcloud/SOURCES.md and in the add-cloud-provider
// skill.

// TestSavedPageProblems pins the checker the rule runs, on a probe tree held as
// a list of slash-separated paths relative to the module root. A path the allow
// list does not name is refused when its extension is that of a saved page
// (.html, .htm, .xhtml, .xht, .shtml, .mhtml, .mht, .webarchive, in any case) or
// when a directory segment ends in _files, in any case, the asset directory a
// browser writes beside a "Webpage, Complete" copy. Each refused path gets
// exactly one problem, in input order, naming the path and pointing to the
// SOURCES.md convention.
