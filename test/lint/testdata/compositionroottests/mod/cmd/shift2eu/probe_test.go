// The CLI composition root's _test.go file, for
// TestCompositionRootTestsReachNoForeignCodeProbe: every import that ends in a
// want comment is one the composition-root-tests rule refuses, and each stands
// for a way a test can run code the server never runs: start a program (os/exec),
// hand a path to a CGI handler (net/http/cgi), load a plugin (plugin), read a tree
// (go/build), call C (runtime/cgo), look a user up in the OS database (os/user,
// issue #152), or reach any package's symbol through unsafe. The imports are
// used, so the file type-checks, and no line does anything at run time: the probe
// lints the file and never runs it.
