// Package cli stands for the CLI's production code, which neither
// composition-root group reaches: those two hold for files under cmd/shift2eu/
// and cmd/shift2eu-server/ only, which their linters.exclusions.rules say and
// TestCompositionRootExclusions checks. What the CLI may not do is its own
// group's business (issue #152): cli-no-env-or-process refuses every way to
// read, write or dump the environment, to locate a home, config, cache or temp
// directory, and to start a process, so a composition root that delegates the
// read to the CLI cannot read the variable a root may not. Every line below
// that ends in a want comment is one of those calls, and the want names the
// group's tag.
//
// The calls the CLI really makes keep no want comment: it opens the inventory a
// user names, reads it, and creates the report the user asked for (--inventory,
// --output). os stays allowed in the CLI's import rule for exactly that reason,
// and the group names the calls on the environment, not the package.
//
// The imports the CLI may not make at all (syscall, unsafe, os/exec) are held by
// the CLI's import rule, cli-gets-adapters-from-cmd, which
// TestCLIImportsProbe lints; this file imports os alone, as the CLI does today.
